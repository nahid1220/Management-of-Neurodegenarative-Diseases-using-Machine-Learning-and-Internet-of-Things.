	abstract = {For more than a century the research on Motor Neuron Disease (MND) has been dominated by a tension between the concept of a selective, purely motor degeneration and a growing realisation of the high frequency and importance of cognitive symptoms that can culminate in dementia. The present paper aims at integrating these two, seemingly mutually exclusive interpretations of the disease. It is proposed that the cognitive and motor symptoms in MND are due to the same selective neurodegenerative process, spreading along the lines of functional connections in the nervous system. Accordingly, the most impaired aspects of cognitive function are those with the closest functional links to the motor system, a pattern explaining a disproportionate impairment of verb and action processing in this disease. The dementia associated with MND can be interpreted as the fifth major clinical presentation of MND, alongside bulbar, thoracic, upper and lower limb presentation. It follows the same rules of disease progression as other presentations, spreading contiguously from region to region, with a predominantly caudal direction. Accordingly, dementia tends to precede other presentations and is often followed by bulbar symptoms. We believe that the presented model contributes to a more accurate concept of MND, integrating cognitive and motor features within the same disease mechanism. At the same time it highlights the importance of MND for cognitive neuroscience and, in particular, for theories of embodied cognition.},

The mutation responsible for HD leads to an abnormally long polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in the huntingtin (Htt) protein, which confers one or more toxic functions to mutant Htt leading to neurodegeneration. The polyQ expansion makes Htt prone to aggregate and accumulate, and manipulations that mitigate protein misfolding or facilitate the clearance of misfolded proteins tend to slow disease progression in HD models.

	abstract = {Diagnosis of neurological diseases is a growing concern and one of the most difficult challenges for modern medicine. According to the World Health Organisation’s recent report, neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease and stroke to headache, affect up to one billion people worldwide. An estimated 6.8 million people die every year as a result of neurological disorders. Current diagnosis technologies (e.g. magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalogram) produce huge quantity data (in size and dimension) for detection, monitoring and treatment of neurological diseases. In general, analysis of those medical big data is performed manually by experts to identify and understand the abnormalities. It is really difficult task for a person to accumulate, manage, analyse and assimilate such large volumes of data by visual inspection. As a result, the experts have been demanding computerised diagnosis systems, called “computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)” that can automatically detect the neurological abnormalities using the medical big data. This system improves consistency of diagnosis and increases the success of treatment, save lives and reduce cost and time. Recently, there are some research works performed in the development of the CAD systems for management of medical big data for diagnosis assessment. This paper explores the challenges of medical big data handing and also introduces the concept of the CAD system how it works. This paper also provides a survey of developed CAD methods in the area of neurological diseases diagnosis. This study will help the experts to have some idea and understanding how the CAD system can assist them in this point.},

Mining such an enormous amount of data for pattern recognition is a big challenge and requires sophisticated data-intensive machine learning techniques. Artificial neural network-based learning systems are well known for their pattern recognition capabilities and lately their deep architectures - known as deep learning (DL) - have been successfully applied to solve many complex pattern recognition problems. Highlighting the role of DL in recognizing patterns in biological data, this article provides - applications of DL to biological sequences, images, and signals data; overview of open access sources of these data; description of open source DL tools applicable on these data; and comparison of these tools from qualitative and quantitative perspectives.

	abstract = {Since falls are a major public health problem in an aging society, there is considerable demand for low-cost fall detection systems. One of the main reasons for non-acceptance of the currently available solutions by seniors is that the fall detectors using only inertial sensors generate too much false alarms. This means that some daily activities are erroneously signaled as fall, which in turn leads to frustration of the users. In this paper we present how to design and implement a low-cost system for reliable fall detection with very low false alarm ratio. The detection of the fall is done on the basis of accelerometric data and depth maps. A tri-axial accelerometer is used to indicate the potential fall as well as to indicate whether the person is in motion. If the measured acceleration is higher than an assumed threshold value, the algorithm extracts the person, calculates the features and then executes the SVM-based classifier to authenticate the fall alarm. It is a 365/7/24 embedded system permitting unobtrusive fall detection as well as preserving privacy of the user.},

	abstract = {Essential tremor (ET) is a highly prevalent movement disorder. Patients with ET exhibit a complex progressive and disabling tremor, and medical management often fails. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been successfully applied to this disorder, however there has been no quantifiable way to measure tremor severity or treatment efficacy in this patient population. The quantified amelioration of kinetic tremor via DBS is herein demonstrated through the application of a smartphone (iPhone) as a wireless accelerometer platform. The recorded acceleration signal can be obtained at a setting of the subject's convenience and conveyed by wireless transmission through the Internet for post-processing anywhere in the world. Further post-processing of the acceleration signal can be classified through a machine learning application, such as the support vector machine. Preliminary application of deep brain stimulation with a smartphone for acquisition of a feature set and machine learning for classification has been successfully applied. The support vector machine achieved 100\% classification between deep brain stimulation in `on' and `off' mode based on the recording of an accelerometer signal through a smartphone as a wireless accelerometer platform.},

	abstract = {Injuries that are caused by falls have been regarded as one of the major health threats to the independent living for the elderly. Conventional fall detection systems have various limitations. In this work, we first look for the correlations between different radio signal variations and activities by analyzing radio propagation model. Based on our observation, we propose WiFall, a truly unobtrusive fall detection system. WiFall employs physical layer Channel State Information (CSI) as the indicator of activities. It can detect fall of the human without hardware modification, extra environmental setup, or any wearable device. We implement WiFall on desktops equipped with commodity 802.11n NIC, and evaluate the performance in three typical indoor scenarios with several layouts of transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) links. In our area of interest, WiFall can achieve fall detection for a single person with high accuracy. As demonstrated by the experimental results, WiFall yields 90 percent detection precision with a false alarm rate of 15 percent on average using a one-class SVM classifier in all testing scenarios. It can also achieve average 94 percent fall detection precisions with 13 percent false alarm using Random Forest algorithm.},

	abstract = {The increasing popularity of wearable devices in recent years means that a diverse range of physiological and functional data can now be captured continuously for applications in sports, wellbeing, and healthcare. This wealth of information requires efficient methods of classification and analysis where deep learning is a promising technique for large-scale data analytics. While deep learning has been successful in implementations that utilize high-performance computing platforms, its use on low-power wearable devices is limited by resource constraints. In this paper, we propose a deep learning methodology, which combines features learned from inertial sensor data together with complementary information from a set of shallow features to enable accurate and real-time activity classification. The design of this combined method aims to overcome some of the limitations present in a typical deep learning framework where on-node computation is required. To optimize the proposed method for real-time on-node computation, spectral domain preprocessing is used before the data are passed onto the deep learning framework. The classification accuracy of our proposed deep learning approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using both laboratory and real world activity datasets. Our results show the validity of the approach on different human activity datasets, outperforming other methods, including the two methods used within our combined pipeline. We also demonstrate that the computation times for the proposed method are consistent with the constraints of real-time on-node processing on smartphones and a wearable sensor platform.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we describe the PERFORM system for the continuous remote monitoring and management of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. The PERFORM system is an intelligent closed-loop system that seamlessly integrates a wide range of wearable sensors constantly monitoring several motor signals of the PD patients. Data acquired  are pre-processed by advanced knowledge processing methods, integrated by fusion algorithms to allow health professionals to remotely monitor the overall status of the patients, adjust medication schedules and personalize treatment. The information collected by the sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) is processed by several classifiers. As a result, it is possible to evaluate and quantify the PD motor symptoms related to end of dose deterioration (tremor, bradykinesia, freezing of gait (FoG)) as well as those related to  over-dose concentration (Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID)). Based on this information, together with information derived from tests performed with a virtual reality glove and information about the medication and food intake, a patient specific profile can be built. In addition, the patient specific profile with his evaluation during the last week and last month, is compared to understand whether his status is stable, improving or worsening. Based on that, the system analyses whether a medication change is needed—always under medical supervision—and in this case, information about the medication change proposal is sent to the patient. The performance of the system has been evaluated in real life conditions, the accuracy and acceptability of the system by the PD patients and healthcare professionals has been tested, and a comparison with the standard routine clinical evaluation done by the PD patients’ physician has been carried out. The PERFORM system is used by the PD patients and in a simple and safe non-invasive way for long-term record of their motor status, thus offering to the clinician a precise, long-term and objective view of patient’s motor status and drug/food intake. Thus, with the PERFORM system the clinician can remotely receive precise information for the PD patient’s status on previous days and define the optimal therapeutical treatment.},

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and degenerative disorder of body movement, affecting people between the ages of 50 and 60. Freezing of Gait (FOG) is a symptom of the advanced stage of PD, associated with gait disorders with prominent risk falls; these drops cause stress, pain and are the main cause of death by injury. In this research, was developed a hardware-based wireless system non-invasive for the acquisition of real-time data from PD patients presenting with FOG episodes to stimulate walking progression, prevent falls, and improve patients' lifestyles. This was achieved by placing a stimulator device near the posterior tibial nerve of the lower extremities. The patients' gait is automatically detected by a three-axis accelerometer coupled to an inertial measurement unit (IMU). To make the data is raised three typical scenarios of occurrence of FOG: walk in a straight line, turns of 180 degrees, up and down steps, the data will be read and stored in a processor and transmitted to the smartphone via Bluetooth. Detected the FOG, generates a signal that produces vibratory stimulation, helping to break the FOG or avoiding it. The features of the devices are: use of surface sensors, low cost, portable, easy use and lightweight, in addition, a smartphone is used for monitoring and processing. For the validation of the system was done analytically based on specificity, sensitivity and effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Falls can cause serious traumas such as brain injuries and bone fractures, especially among elderly people. Fear of falling might reduce physical activities resulting in declining social interactions and eventually causing depression. To lessen the effects of a fall, timely delivery of medical treatment can play a vital role. In a similar scenario, an IoT-based wearable system can pave the most promising way to mitigate serious consequences of a fall while providing the convenience of usage. However, to deliver sufficient degree of monitoring and reliability, wearable devices working at the core of fall detection systems are required to work for a prolonged period of time. In this work, we focus on energy efficiency of a wearable sensor node in an Internet-of-Things (IoT) based fall detection system. We propose the design of a tiny, lightweight, flexible and energy efficient wearable device. We investigate different parameters (e.g. sampling rate, communication bus interface, transmission protocol, and transmission rate) impacting on energy consumption of the wearable device. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption of the wearable in different configurations and operating conditions. Furthermore, we provide hints (hardware and software) for system designers implementing the optimal wearable device for IoT-based fall detection systems in terms of energy efficiency and high quality of service. The results clearly indicate that the proposed sensor node is novel and energy efficient. In a critical condition, the wearable device can be used continuously for 76 h with a 1000 mAh li-ion battery.},

	abstract = {Human errors are probably the most critical cause of the large amount of medical accidents. Medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) have been suggested as a possible approach for detecting and limiting the impact of errors and wrong procedures. However, during the initial development phase of medical instruments, regular MCPS systems are not a viable approach, because of the high costs of repeating complex validation procedures, due to modifications of the prototype instrument. In this work, a communication architecture, inspired by recent Internet of Things (IoT) advances, is proposed for connecting prototype instruments to the cloud, to allow direct and real-time interaction between developers and instrument operators. Without loss of generality, a real-world use case is addressed, dealing with the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for neurodegenerative disease diagnosis. The proposed infrastructure leverages on a message-oriented middleware, complemented by historical database for further data processing. Two of the most diffused protocols for cloud data exchange (MQTT and AMQP) have been investigated. The experimental setup has been focused on the real-time performance, which are the most challenging requirements. Time-related metrics confirm the feasibility of the proposed approach, resulting in an end-to-end delay on the order of few tens of milliseconds for local networks and up to few hundreds of milliseconds for geographical scale networks.},

	abstract = {Parkinson's Disease (PD) is one of the most severe neurological diseases prevalent in the world. A neurodegenerative disease, it impairs the body's balance, damages motor skills, and leads to disorder in speech production. These problems also affect decision-making processes and the expression of emotions. In this paper, we propose a PD monitoring framework for use in smart cities. Using this framework, city residents will have their health constantly monitored and get feedback on their PD situation. Early PD symptoms can, therefore, be detected and the proper medication provided. In this framework, we use speech signals from clients captured from various sensors and transmitted to the cloud for processing. In the cloud, decisions are made using a support vector machine-based classifier. Decisions, along with the signal features, are sent to registered doctors, who then prescribe certain medications to the client. Several experiments were performed, with the results demonstrating that the proposed framework can achieve 97.2\% accuracy in detecting PD.},

	abstract = {The recent reports on population ageing in the most advanced countries are driving governments and the scientific community to focus on technologies for providing assistance to people in their own homes. Particular attention has been devoted to solutions based on acoustic signals since they provide a convenient way to monitor people activities and they enable hands-free human–machine interfaces. In this context, this paper presents a complete solution for voice command recognition and emergency detection based on audio signals entirely integrated in a low-consuming embedded platform. The system combines an active operation mode were distress calls are captured and a vocal interface is enabled for controlling the home automation subsystem, and a pro-active mode, were a novelty detection algorithm detects abnormal acoustic events to alert the user of a possible emergency. In the first operation mode, a Voice Activity Detector captures voice segments of the audio signal, and a speech recogniser detects commands and distress calls. In the pro-active mode, an acoustic novelty detector is employed in order to be able to deal with unknown sounds, thus not requiring an explicit modelling of emergency sounds. In addition, the system integrates a VoIP infrastructure so that emergencies can be communicated to relatives or care centres. The monitoring unit is equipped with multiple microphones and it is connected to the home local area network to communicate with the home automation subsystem. The algorithms have been implemented in a low-consuming embedded platform based on a ARM Cortex-A8 CPU. The effectiveness of the adopted algorithms has been tested on two different databases: ITAAL and A3Novelty. The obtained results show that the adopted solutions are suitable for speech and audio event monitoring in a realistic scenario.},

In this context, the outsourcing of computation and storage resources to general IT providers (cloud computing) has become very appealing. E-health clouds offer new possibilities, such as easy and ubiquitous access to medical data, and opportunities for new business models. However, they also bear new risks and raise challenges with respect to security and privacy aspects. In this paper, we point out several shortcomings of current e-health solutions and standards, particularly they do not address the client platform security, which is a crucial aspect for the overall security of e-health systems. To fill this gap, we present a security architecture for establishing privacy domains in e-health infrastructures. Our solution provides client platform security and appropriately combines this with network security concepts. Moreover, we discuss further open problems and research challenges on security, privacy and usability of e-health cloud systems.},

	abstract = {With the popularity of wearable devices, along with the development of clouds and cloudlet technology, there has been increasing need to provide better medical care. The processing chain of medical data mainly includes data collection, data storage and data sharing, etc. Traditional healthcare system often requires the delivery of medical data to the cloud, which involves users’ sensitive information and causes communication energy consumption. Practically, medical data sharing is a critical and challenging issue. Thus in this paper, we build up a novel healthcare system by utilizing the flexibility of cloudlet. The functions of cloudlet include privacy protection, data sharing and intrusion detection. In the stage of data collection, we first utilize Number Theory Research Unit (NTRU) method to encrypt user’s body data collected by wearable devices. Those data will be transmitted to nearby cloudlet in an energy efficient fashion. Secondly, we present a new trust model to help users to select trustable partners who want to share stored data in the cloudlet. The trust model also helps similar patients to communicate with each other about their diseases. Thirdly, we divide users’ medical data stored in remote cloud of hospital into three parts, and give them proper protection. Finally, in order to protect the healthcare system from malicious attacks, we develop a novel collaborative intrusion detection system (IDS) method based on cloudlet mesh, which can effectively prevent the remote healthcare big data cloud from attacks. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

One key issue for video-based facial expression analysis in practice is how to extract dynamic features. In this paper, a novel approach is presented using histogram sequence of local Gabor binary patterns from three orthogonal planes (LGBP-TOP). In this approach, every facial expression sequence is firstly convolved with the multi-scale and multi-orientation Gabor filters to extract the Gabor Magnitude Sequences (GMSs). Then, we use local binary patterns from three orthogonal planes (LBP-TOP) on each GMS to further enhance the feature extraction. Finally, the facial expression sequence is modeled as a histogram sequence by concatenating the histogram pieces of all the local regions of all the LGBP-TOP maps. For recognition, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is exploited. Our experimental results on the extended Cohn-Kanade database (CK+) demonstrate that the proposed method has achieved the best results compared to other methods in recent years.},

	abstract = {Emotions are characterized as responses to internal and external events of a person. Emotion recognition through facial expressions from videos plays a vital role in human computer interaction where the dynamic changes in face movements needs to be realized quickly. In this work, we propose a simple method, using the geometrical based approach for the recognition of six basic emotions in video sequences of BU-4DFE database. We have chosen optimum feature points out of the 83 feature points provided in the BU-4DFE database. A video expressing emotion will have frames containing neutral, onset, apex and offset of that emotion. We have dynamically identified the frame that is most expressive for an emotion (apex). The Euclidean distance between the feature points in apex and neutral frame is determined and their difference in corresponding neutral and the apex frame is calculated to form the feature vector. The feature vectors thus formed for all the emotions and subjects are given to Neural Networks (NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with different kernels for classification. We have compared the accuracy obtained by NN \& SVM. Our proposed method is simple, uses only two frames and yields good accuracy for BU-4DFE database. Very complex algorithms exist in literature using BU-4DFE database and our proposed simple method gives comparable results. It can be applied for real time implementation and kinesics in future.},

Traditionally, facial emotion recognition systems have been evaluated on laboratory controlled data, which is not representative of the environment faced in real-world applications. To robustly recognize the facial emotions in real-world natural situations, this paper proposes an approach called extreme sparse learning, which has the ability to jointly learn a dictionary (set of basis) and a nonlinear classification model. The proposed approach combines the discriminative power of extreme learning machine with the reconstruction property of sparse representation to enable accurate classification when presented with noisy signals and imperfect data recorded in natural settings. In addition, this paper presents a new local spatio-temporal descriptor that is distinctive and pose-invariant. The proposed framework is able to achieve the state-of-the-art recognition accuracy on both acted and spontaneous facial emotion databases.},

In this study, the authors propose a novel approach for appearance-based facial feature extraction to perform the task of facial expression recognition on video sequences. The proposed spatiotemporal texture map (STTM) is capable of capturing subtle spatial and temporal variations of facial expressions with low computational complexity. First, face is detected using Viola–Jones face detector and frames are cropped to remove unnecessary background. Facial features are then modelled with the proposed STTM, which uses the spatiotemporal information extracted from three-dimensional Harris corner function. A block-based method is adopted to extract the dynamic features and represent the features in the form of histograms. The features are then classified into classes of emotion by the support vector machine classifier. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach shows superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches with an average recognition rate of 95.37, 98.56, and 84.52\% on datasets containing posed expressions, spontaneous micro-expressions, and close-to-real-world expressions, respectively. They also show that the proposed algorithm requires low computational cost.},

	abstract = {Facial expression recognition is one of the open problems in computer vision. Robust neutral face recognition in real time is a major challenge for various supervised learning-based facial expression recognition methods. This is due to the fact that supervised methods cannot accommodate all appearance variability across the faces with respect to race, pose, lighting, facial biases, and so on, in the limited amount of training data. Moreover, processing each and every frame to classify emotions is not required, as user stays neutral for majority of the time in usual applications like video chat or photo album/web browsing. Detecting neutral state at an early stage, thereby bypassing those frames from emotion classification would save the computational power. In this paper, we propose a light-weight neutral versus emotion classification engine, which acts as a pre-processer to the traditional supervised emotion classification approaches. It dynamically learns neutral appearance at key emotion (KE) points using a statistical texture model, constructed by a set of reference neutral frames for each user. The proposed method is made robust to various types of user head motions by accounting for affine distortions based on a statistical texture model. Robustness to dynamic shift of KE points is achieved by evaluating the similarities on a subset of neighborhood patches around each KE point using the prior information regarding the directionality of specific facial action units acting on the respective KE point. The proposed method, as a result, improves emotion recognition (ER) accuracy and simultaneously reduces computational complexity of the ER system, as validated on multiple databases.},

	abstract = {The human face is used to identify other people, to regulate the conversation by gazing or nodding, to interpret what has been said by lip reading, and to communicate and understand social signals, including affective states and intentions, on the basis of the shown facial expression. Machine understanding of human facial signals could revolutionize user-adaptive social interfaces, the integral part of ambient intelligence technologies. Nonetheless, development of a face-based ambient interface that detects and interprets human facial signals is rather difficult. This article summarizes our efforts in achieving this goal, enumerates the scientific and engineering issues that arise in meeting this challenge and outlines recommendations for accomplishing this objective.},

	abstract = {Human face detection plays an important role in applications such as video surveillance, human computer interface, face recognition, and face image database management. We propose a face detection algorithm for color images in the presence of varying lighting conditions as well as complex backgrounds. Based on a novel lighting compensation technique and a nonlinear color transformation, our method detects skin regions over the entire image and then generates face candidates based on the spatial arrangement of these skin patches. The algorithm constructs eye, mouth, and boundary maps for verifying each face candidate. Experimental results demonstrate successful face detection over a wide range of facial variations in color, position, scale, orientation, 3D pose, and expression in images from several photo collections (both indoors and outdoors).},

	abstract = {The hybridization of rough sets and fuzzy sets has focused on creating an end product that extends both contributing computing paradigms in a conservative way. As a result, the hybrid theory inherits their respective strengths, but also exhibits some weaknesses. In particular, although they allow for gradual membership, fuzzy rough sets are still abrupt in a sense that adding or omitting a single element may drastically alter the outcome of the approximations. In this paper, we revisit the hybridization process by introducing vague quantifiers like “some” or “most” into the definition of upper and lower approximation. The resulting vaguely quantified rough set (VQRS) model is closely related to Ziarko’s variable precision rough set (VPRS) model.},
